Web Visualizations Challenge:

I create a visualization dashboard website (https://nnorman312.github.io/WebVisualizations/index.html) using visualizations from my python-api-challenge repository where I addressed a fundamental question: "What's the weather like as we approach the equator?"

In building this dashboard, I create individual pages for each plot: Latitude vs. Temperature (F), Latitude vs. Humidity (%), Latitude vs. Cloudiness (%), and Latitude vs. Wind Speed (mph). 

I include a means by which to navigate between the different pages. These pages also contain visualizations and their corresponding explanations. I also create a landing page, a page to compare all of the plots, and another page that includes the data used to build them.

Plot.ly Challenge:

I build an interactive dashboard (https://nnorman312.github.io/Plot.ly/index.html) to explore a Belly Button Biodiversity dataset, which catalogs the microbes that colonize human navels. The dataset reveals that a small handful of microbial species (also called operational taxonomic units, or OTUs, in the study) were present in more than 70% of people, while the rest were relatively rare.

Within the dashboard, I create a horizontal bar chart with a dropdown menu to display the top 10 OTUs found in an individual. I also create a bubble chart that displays each sample. Further, I display the sample metadata (an individual's demographic information), as well as each key-value pair from the metadata JSON object.

Any time that a new sample is selected, all of the plots update.
