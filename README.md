Web Visualizations Challenge:

I create a visualization dashboard website (https://nnorman312.github.io/WebVisualizations/index.html) using visualizations from my python-api-challenge repository where I addressed a fundamental question: "What's the weather like as we approach the equator?"

In building this dashboard, I create individual pages for each plot: Latitude vs. Temperature (F), Latitude vs. Humidity (%), Latitude vs. Cloudiness (%), and Latitude vs. Wind Speed (mph). 

I include a means by which to navigate between the different pages. These pages also contain visualizations and their corresponding explanations. I also create a landing page, a page to compare all of the plots, and another page that includes the data used to build them.

Plot.ly Challenge:

I build an interactive dashboard (https://nnorman312.github.io/Plot.ly/index.html) to explore a Belly Button Biodiversity dataset, which catalogs the microbes that colonize human navels. The dataset reveals that a small handful of microbial species (also called operational taxonomic units, or OTUs, in the study) were present in more than 70% of people, while the rest were relatively rare.

Within the dashboard, I complete the following:
- Create a horizontal bar chart with a dropdown menu to display the top 10 OTUs found in the selected individual
- Create a bubble chart that displays the bacteria cultures per sample
- Create a gauge chart to plot the weekly washing frequency of the individual
- Display the individual's demographic information and each key-value pair from the dataset

D3 Challenge:

Using information from the U.S. Census Bureau and D3 techniques, I create an interactive scatter plot that displays health risks of certain demographics by state. I code this graphic in the app.js file and pull in the data from data.csv. The scatter plot includes interchangable variables such as Age (Median) vs. Smokes (%), In Poverty (%) vs. Obesity (%), and Household Income (Median) vs. Lacks Healthcare(%).
